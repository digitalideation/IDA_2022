- terminal basics
- url writing, directory listing
- css pseudo classes
- css transitions
- #id tags
- hmtl links

### Terminal basics

#### **Mac**:

> Open the Applications folder. Than open the Utilities folder. In there you can find the the Terminal application.

**commands**:

`whoami` = returns current user

`pwd` = print write directory | returns the current directory

`touch some_file.extension` = create an empty file

`cd some/directory/inside/another/directory` = change directory | move from one place to another in your machine

`ls` = list all file and directories in current directory

`mkdir directory_name` = create emty directory

`open file.extension` = open file with default application

`say something` = let your computer talk

#### **Windows**:

> Press the Start taskbar button. Select All apps on the Start menu. Scroll down the Start menu to the Windows Terminal app shown directly below. Then click Windows Terminal there to open it

**Commands**:

`type nul >> "file.txt"` or `copy nul "file.txt"` = create an empty file

`cd some/directory/inside/another/directory` = change directory | move from one place to another in your machine

`dir` = list all file and directories in current directory

`mkdir directory_name` = create emty directory

#### Exercise 1

> Create a folder with the current directory structure:

```
directory_name/
    - index.html
    - assets/
        - style.css
        - js/
            - scripts.js
```

> then link all of the files from the index.html using the link and script tag

the `style.css` file should look like this:

```css
body {
  background-color: #33f;
}
```

the `script.js` should look like this

```javascript
console.log("hello from script.js");
```

the `index.html` should look like this

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>some title</title>
    <!-- here you should link your css using the link tag -->
    <!-- here you should link the js file using the script tag -->
  </head>

  <body></body>
</html>
```

#### end of exercise

#### Exercise 2

> in the same directory as the previous exercise create a directory called data where you will create an html file for each day of the past week from last friday to yesterday, and naming them accordingly. Than in the index.html file that you created in the previous exercise link all of the days in the data folder with the a tag

each file `day_of_the_week.html` should look like this

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <!-- CHANGE THE TITLE BELOW -->
    <title>day of the week</title>
    <!-- here you should link your css using the link tag -->
    <!-- here you should link the js file using the script tag -->
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>day of the week</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

### css pseudo classes and transitions

- given the previous exercise create id for each a tag that links to a `day_of_the_week.html`, it should look like this:

```html
<a href="link/to/day_of_the_week.html" id="day-of-the-week">day of the week</a>
```

- then style such id according to your personal aesthetic taste. Therefore go to your `style.css` file and change it accrodingly, it should look like this:

```css
body {
  background-color: #33f;
}

#day-of-the-week {
  /* put here some styling that ou like */
}
```
